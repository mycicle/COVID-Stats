# COVID-Stats
I think the CDC reports its COVID statistics in literally the worst way physically possible. I will put up some normally formatted visualizations of important COVID information



## Proposed TODO
*death rate over time ages 0-18 per state
*death rate over time ages 19-65 per state
*death rate over time ages 66+ per state

COVID death rate vs death rate from influenza ages 0-18 per state
COVID death rate vs death rate from influenza ages 19-65 per state
COVID death rate vs death rate from influenza ages 66+ per state

Daily fatality rate from COVID per state vs. Daily fatality rate from infleunza per state






##choose a few countries: The US, China, The UK, Spain, Sweden (for later)
death rate over time ages 0-18 per country
death rate over time ages 19-65 per country
death rate over time ages 66+ per country
